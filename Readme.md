# ImageGrains  
   
A software library for segmenting and measuring of sedimentary particles in images. The segmentation is done with the *cellpose* algorithm  (https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose), designed cell and nucleus segmentation in biomedical images. Its segmentation capability is transferred to geoscientific applications throurgh re-training of the algorithm with images of sediment particles (from our data (**link to repo**) or custom; **link to preprint**).

## Installation 
    
### Local installation  

The easiest way to install the software is by using the conda package manager. If you do not have conda installed, please follow the instructions on the [conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  
   
To install the software, open an anaconda prompt / command prompt, then create a new environment with
```
conda create --name imagegrains python=3.8
```
and activate it with 
```
conda activate imagegrains
```

First install cellpose, its GUI and dependancies (which includes [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [pyqtgrapgh](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/), [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/5minguide.html), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [natsort](https://natsort.readthedocs.io/en/master/)) 
```
python -m pip install cellpose[gui]
```

Details and more installation options of cellpose (including GPU versions for Windows and Linux) are found [here](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose#installation).

Then, install the additional dependancies:  

- jupyter
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- pandas

***TO DO: ***
***- ship as package***
***- environment file (maybe?)***
***- make it run in google colab***
***- create command-line executable***
***- do short manual***
