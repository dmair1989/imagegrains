# ImageGrains  
   
A software library for segmenting and measuring of sedimentary particles in images. The segmentation is done with the *cellpose* algorithm  (https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose), designed cell and nucleus segmentation in biomedical images. Its segmentation capability is transferred to geoscientific applications throurgh re-training of the algorithm with images of sediment particles (from our data (**link to repo**) or custom; **link to preprint**).

## Installation 
    
### Local installation  

The easiest way to install the software is by using the conda package manager. If you do not have conda installed, please follow the instructions on the [conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  
   
To install the software, open an anaconda prompt / command prompt, then create a new environment with
```
conda create --name imagegrains python=3.8
```
and activate it with 
```
conda activate imagegrains
```

First install cellpose and its GUI 
```
python -m pip install cellpose[gui]
```

Then, install the additional dependancies:  

- jupyter
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- pandas
